# Graph Creation and Data Retrieval

This repository contains code for creating and retrieving data from a graph. It is developed as part of a project at FAMAF (Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física y Computación) in Córdoba, Argentina. The main objective of this project is to implement a graph coloring algorithm by developing auxiliary functions that will be used in conjunction with other functions to achieve different coloring strategies.

The project is divided into several stages, and this document specifically focuses on the functions related to the first stage. In this initial stage, the code emphasizes reading the graph data, storing it in a suitable data structure, and providing convenient access to the data. The functions included in this stage allow you to obtain information such as the number of vertices and edges, access the names and degrees of the vertices, and identify the neighbors of a given vertex.

It is crucial to follow the specifications provided for these functions, as they serve as the foundation for subsequent stages. Any deviations from the specifications may introduce errors and complicate the correction process in later stages. Therefore, it is highly recommended to program the functions according to the given guidelines.

The code is written in C and adheres to the C99 standard. Please ensure that you follow the specifications and implement the functions accordingly to successfully complete the project. Note that this code alone does not provide a complete graph coloring solution but rather establishes the necessary groundwork for later stages.

**Input Format:** The expected input format for the graph data is a variation of the DIMACS format. Make sure to provide the input data in the specified format to obtain accurate results.

Contributions and improvements are welcome to enhance the graph coloring algorithm using the provided functions. Please refer to the project's documentation for further instructions and guidelines on utilizing this codebase effectively.
